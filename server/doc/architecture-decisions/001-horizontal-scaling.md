# Horizontal Scaling Implementation

## Context
Our BazaarCSTD application needs to handle growing user demand and ensure high availability.

## Decision
We've implemented horizontal scaling using:
1. Docker containers for application packaging
2. Nginx as a load balancer
3. Optimized PostgreSQL connection pooling
4. Stateless application architecture

## Benefits
- Improved availability through redundancy
- Better resource utilization
- Ability to handle increased load by adding instances
- Simplified deployment process

## Implementation
- Three application instances running behind Nginx
- Load balancing using least connections algorithm
- Database connection pooling optimized for multiple app instances
- Docker Compose for orchestration in both dev and production environments
